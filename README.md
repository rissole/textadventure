# TextAdventure
A text adventure game engine written in C++. The project is planned to load maps
from XML files that define the game to be played. Additionally a Lua scripting engine is planned for more diverse and dynamic text adventure experiences.

Another key planned feature is "joining maps". That is to say, one map can have a room that leads into a room in a completely different map. The overall vision behind this is to create an endless, extensible, and extremely collaborative adventure creating experience.

# Dependencies
rapidxml library. Used version 1.13.
